      <h1><strong>Collisions</strong> - A simple physics simulation of elastic 2D collisions</h1>
      <h2>By Namanyay Goel</h2>
    </header>

    <p>Collisions is a quick demo in canvas to show how 2D collisions happen. Originally created to act as a cool background, but the author later realized that it is better as a physics simulator, showing how gases operate microscropically.</p>
    <p>This has a few bugs, but works pretty well. Refresh if this gets too crazy.</p>
