    <p>Collisions is a quick demo in canvas to show how 2D collisions happen. Created to act as a cool background, the author soon realized its use as physics simulator. Collisions henceforth shows a microscopic view of gas particles.</p>
    <p>100% original code. It has a few bugs, but works pretty well.</p>
    <p>Made with ‚ù§ in India.</p>
