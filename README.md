# Collisions
## A simple physics simulation of elastic 2D collisions by Namanyay Goel

[Check it out](http://projects.namanyayg.com/collisions)

Collisions is a quick demo in canvas to show how 2D collisions happen. Originally created to act as a cool background, but the author later realized that it is better as a physics simulator, showing how gases operate microscropically.

This has a few bugs, but works pretty well. Refresh if this gets too crazy.
